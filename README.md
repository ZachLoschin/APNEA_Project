# APNEA_Project

For the detection of spindles and classification of spindle parameters for statistical analysis of spindles in Hodgkin Lymphoma survivors and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients.

Spindle detection and post processing functions completed as of 6/24/2022

To run any functions for testing you will need a .edf file in your local directory.

Be sure to change the paths at the top of any .py file you would like to run to your local directories.

If you have access to the cluster folders, be very careful to not run a mkdir() command and overwrite any data!

Counting sheep, deep breaths

Spindles dancing in my head

Weaving peaceful dreams
