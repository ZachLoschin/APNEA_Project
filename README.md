# APNEA_Project

Currently running Block3_0 on 6/21/2022.

To run any code you will need to install the requirements.txt using the command "pip install -r requirements.txt".

You will also need to download one of the example edf files and be sure to specify the path correctly.

If you contribute, do NOT run any mkdir commands in the APNEA folder if you are not 100 percent sure that you are not overwriting anything.

# Spindle Haiku:

Counting sheep, deep breaths

Spindles dancing in my head

Weaving peaceful dreams
